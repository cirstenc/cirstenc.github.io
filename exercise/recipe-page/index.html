        <h1>BEEF BONE BROTH</h1>
        <p>
            There’s nothing like a cozy, warm bowl of beef bone broth, 
            especially when the weather starts to cool down. This homemade 
            version has all the flavor and goodness you’ll ever need, and it’s 
            so much better than anything you’ll find on store shelves! Roasting
            the bones and veggies before simmering them adds layers of deep, 
            rich flavor, and with warming spices like cinnamon and turmeric, 
            this broth is perfect for sipping straight or using as a base for
            soups, stews, or even sauces. Let’s dive into how to make this 
            cozy, nutrient-packed beef bone broth in the Instant Pot!
        </p>

        >
        <h1>PREPPING THE BONES AND VEGGIES</h1>
        <p>
            First, let’s talk about the bones! You want a mix of different 
            types to get the best flavor and texture. You can use marrow bones
            for that rich flavor, knuckle bones or joints for extra collagen,
            short ribs for some added meaty bits, or oxtails for a balance of
            both. I personally used a combination of short ribs, oxtail, 
            and bone marrow in this batch, but feel free to mix and match
            depending on what you have or can find.
        </p>
        <p>
            Start by boiling the bones for a bit to remove any impurities. 
            This helps make the broth nice and clean, giving it a better flavor
            and appearance. After a quick boil, drain the water, rinse the 
            bones, and get them ready for the oven.
        </p>
        <p>
            Roasting the bones is key here. It brings out all the rich, 
            deep flavors we love in a broth. Toss your bones, along with 
            roughly chopped celery, carrots, and onions, onto a baking sheet.
            Don’t worry about being precise—just give them a rough chop. 
            Roast everything until you get a beautiful brown color on the 
            bones and a little caramelization on the veggies. Trust me, this
            step makes all the difference!
        </p>
        <h1>BUILDING THE BROTH IN THE INSTANT POT</h1>
        <p>
            Once your bones and veggies are beautifully roasted, it’s time to 
            transfer them to the Instant Pot. Throw in some garlic cloves, thyme 
            sprigs, bay leaves, salt, and a cinnamon stick or two for that extra 
            layer of warmth. We’ll also add a dash of turmeric for its earthy 
            flavor and all its amazing anti-inflammatory health benefits. Don’t 
            forget a few peppercorns and a pinch of cayenne for just a little 
            heat, but you can adjust the spice level to your liking. 
            And finally, a splash of apple cider vinegar. This might seem 
            unusual, but it helps draw out the minerals and nutrients from the 
            bones, making the broth even more nutritious.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, pour in enough water to cover everything. Just be sure not 
            to go past the “Max Fill” line in your Instant Pot! Pop the lid on, 
            set it to high pressure, and let it cook for at least two hours. 
            If you want an even richer broth, you can go for up to four hours. 
            I cooked it on high pressure for three hours. The longer you let 
            it simmer, the deeper the flavor becomes.
        </p>
        <h1>STRAINING AND STORING</h1>
        <p>
            After the broth is done cooking, let the pressure release 
            naturally—this takes about 20 to 30 minutes, but it’s worth the 
            wait. Once the lid is off, you’ll immediately smell how rich and 
            fragrant the broth is! Strain it through a fine-mesh strainer 
            into a large container, discarding the bones, veggies, and spices. 
            If you spot any leftover meat on the bones, feel free to save 
            it—it’s great to add into soups later.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, let the broth cool down before you pop it in the fridge. 
            After a few hours, the fat will solidify on top, making it easy 
            to skim off if you prefer a lighter broth. You can store your 
            broth in the fridge for about five days or freeze it for up to a 
            few months. I love pouring it into ice cube trays and freezing 
            them, so I always have a little broth ready to go for quick recipes!
        </p>
        <h1>TIPS, TRICKS, AND VARIATIONS</h1>
        <p>
            Here’s where you can get creative! Don’t have cinnamon sticks? 
            No problem—leave them out or swap them with another warming spice 
            like cloves or star anise. You can also toss in fresh herbs like 
            parsley or rosemary, or switch up the veggies. If you’ve got leeks,
            fennel, or even parsnips, feel free to throw them in. Bone broth 
            is super versatile, so make it your own!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want a lighter flavor, reduce the roasting time or skip 
            roasting altogether and just boil the bones. But honestly, roasting
            adds so much flavor that I rarely skip it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking for a thicker, gelatin-rich broth? Try adding more knuckle 
            or joint bones—these have a higher collagen content, which gives 
            your broth that silky, luscious texture when chilled. It’s perfect
            if you’re using the broth for sauces or gravies!
        </p>
        <h1>WHAT TO DO WITH LEFTOVERS</h1>
        <p>
            Got leftover broth? Lucky you! This broth is perfect for sipping 
            straight from a mug when you want something cozy and nourishing. 
            You can also use it as a base for soups, stews, or even cook grains
            like rice or quinoa in it for an extra flavor boost. It makes an
            amazing base for ramen or pho, too.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you’re planning ahead, bone broth is the ultimate make-ahead 
            recipe. You can batch-cook a large amount, freeze it, and have it 
            ready for whenever you need a quick meal or just a cozy, warm sip. 
            Just remember to freeze it in smaller portions for easy defrosting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enjoy your cozy bowl of homemade goodness! There’s really nothing 
            better, and once you start making your own, you’ll never go back to
            store-bought.
