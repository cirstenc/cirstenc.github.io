                <h1>Music genre</h1>
                <p>
                    A music genre is a conventional category that identifies 
                    some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or 
                    set of conventions.[1] Genre is to be distinguished from 
                    musical form and musical style, although in practice these 
                    terms are sometimes used interchangeably.[2]
                </p>
                <h2 id="def">Definitions</h2>
                <p>
                    Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and form in 
                    his book Form in Tonal Music. He lists madrigal, motet, 
                    canzona, ricercar, and dance as examples of genres from the 
                    Renaissance period. To further clarify the meaning of 
                    genre, Green writes about "Beethoven's Op. 61" and 
                    "Mendelssohn's Op. 64 ". He explains that both are 
                    identical in genre and are violin concertos that have 
                    different forms. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 
                    511, and the Agnus Dei from his Mass, K. 317, are quite 
                    different in genre but happen to be similar in form."[3]

                <h2 id="cat">Categorization and emergence of new genres</h2>
                <p>
                    The genealogy of musical genres expresses, often in the 
                    form of a written chart. New genres of music can arise 
                    through the development of new styles of music; in addition 
                    to simply creating a new categorization. Although it is 
                    conceivable to create a musical style with no relation to 
                    existing genres, new styles usually appear under the 
                    influence of pre-existing genres.

                <h3 id="auto">Automatic recognition of genres</h3>
                <p>
                    Automatic methods of musical similarity detection, based 
                    on data mining and co-occurrence analysis, have been 
                    developed to classify music titles for electronic music 
                    distribution.[15][16]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Glenn McDonald, the employee of The Echo Nest, music 
                    intelligence and data platform, owned by Spotify, has 
                    created a categorical perception spectrum of genres and 
                    subgenres based on "an algorithmically generated, 
                    readability-adjusted scatter-plot of the musical 
                    genre-space, based on data tracked and analyzed for 5,315 
                    genre-shaped distinctions by Spotify" called Every Noise 
                    at Once.[17][18]

                <h3 id="alter">Alternative approaches</h3>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, music can be assessed on the three 
                    dimensions of "arousal", "valence", and "depth".[19] 
                    Arousal reflects physiological processes such as 
                    stimulation and relaxation (intense, forceful, abrasive, 
                    thrilling vs. gentle, calming, mellow), valence reflects 
                    emotion and mood processes (fun, happy, lively, 
                    enthusiastic, joyful vs. depressing, sad), and depth 
                    reflects cognitive processes (intelligent, sophisticated, 
                    inspiring, complex, poetic, deep, emotional, thoughtful 
                    vs. party music, danceable).[19] These help explain why 
                    many people like similar songs from different traditionally 
                    egregated genres.[19]

                <h3>Art music</h3>
                <p>
                    Art music primarily includes classical traditions, 
                    including both contemporary and historical classical music 
                    forms. Art music exists in many parts of the world. It 
                    emphasizes formal styles that invite technical and 
                    detailed deconstruction[22] and criticism, and demand 
                    focused attention from the listener. In Western practice, 
                    art music is considered primarily a written musical 
                    tradition,[23] preserved in some form of music notation 
                    rather than being transmitted orally, by rote, or in 
                    recordings, as popular and traditional music usually are.
                    [23][24] Historically, most western art music has been 
                    written down using the standard forms of music notation 
                    that evolved in Europe, beginning well before the 
                    Renaissance and reaching its maturity in the Romantic 
                    period.
                </p>
                <h3>Popular music</h3>
                <p>
                    Popular music is any musical style accessible to the 
                    general public and disseminated by the mass media. 
                    Musicologist and popular music specialist Philip Tagg 
                    defined the notion in the light of sociocultural and 
                    economical aspects:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The distinction between classical and popular music has 
                    sometimes been blurred in marginal areas[26] such as 
                    minimalist music and light classics. Background music 
                    for films/movies often draws on both traditions. In this 
                    respect, music is like fiction, which likewise draws a 
                    distinction between literary fiction and popular fiction 
                    that is not always precise.

                <h3>Social influences on music selection</h3>
                <p>
                    Since music has become more easily accessible (Spotify, 
                    iTunes, YouTube, etc.), more people have begun listening 
                    to a broader and wider range of music styles.[44] 
                    In addition, social identity also plays a large role in 
                    music preference. Personality is a key contributor for 
                    music selection. Those who consider themselves to be 
                    "rebels" will tend to choose heavier music styles like 
                    heavy metal or hard rock, while those who consider 
                    themselves to be more "relaxed" or "laid back" will 
                    tend to choose lighter music styles like jazz or classical 
                    music.[44] According to one model, there are five main 
                    factors that exist that underlie music preferences that 
                    are genre-free,[contradictory] and reflect 
                    emotional/affective responses.[45] 
                </p>
                <h3>Individual and situational influences</h3>
                <p>
                    Studies have shown that while women prefer more treble 
                    oriented music, men prefer to listen to bass-heavy music. 
                    A preference for bass-heavy music is sometimes paired with 
                    borderline and antisocial personalities.[46]
